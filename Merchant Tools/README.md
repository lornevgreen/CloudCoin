Accepting CloudCoins Automatically
You can quickly and reliably receive CloudCoins and automatically fill orders.
Your customers will send CloudCoins to your SkyWallet using their CloudCoin Wallet software.
The customers will then send your servers a message specifying what they bought, how many CloudCoins they sent you, and what the "memo" was.
Your servers will then check your SkyWallet account and see if you received a transfer of that amount with the same memo.
Your server can call on our Payment Verifier .exe to do all the work. Just tell the Payment Verifier, the amount, memo, and a few other details. The Payment Verifier will return a true or false.
The Payment Verifier is an executable program that runs on either Windows, Linux, or Mac. It can be called from any language that is able to call executables such as PHP, C#, JAVA, C++, Ruby, almost anything!
The Payment Verifier is here in this GitHub folder.
Sending CloudCoins Automatically
You can send CLoudCoins quickly and reliably to your customer's SkyWallet address by transferring them from your SkyWallet account.
You can call on our Transferrer executable to send the coins.
The Transferrer is here in this GitHub folder.
Echoing the RAIDA
Before you verify payments or transfer funds, you may want to echo the RAIDA to make sure you have connectivity.
