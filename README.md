CloudCoin
This repository provides standards and APIs for CloudCoin, RAIDA, and Sky Wallet.
CloudCoin is a digital currency based on the Theory of Perfect Money. Like crypto-currencies, CloudCoin has data supremacy meaning that it cannot be hacked, brought down by governments, or even corrupted by its own creators. CloudCoin gets its data supremacy in a way similar to how the DNS system gets its data supremacy. CoudCoins have several unique properties, including:
1.	100% Private. No accounts, logins, usernames, or public ledgers that track everything.
2.	Transacts in seconds. It only requires 25 clouds to be updated in parallel.
3.	Globally scalable. Like the DNS, there is a RAIDA root domain and RAIDA subdomains. These domains can handle the entire world's authentication activities.
4.	100% availability. Since its creation in August 2016, the RAIDA has never gone down.
5.	Uses over 10,000 times less electricity than the blockchain. CloudCoin just updates databases. No expensive encryption needed.
6.	No inflation. The amount of CloudCoins is fixed. It will never increase or decrease. Subdomains handle change, and there can be an infinite number of fractions, but these do not create more nominal coins.
7.	Easy addressing. Used with Sky Wallet or other systems, simply use a DNS name for your address, such as Sean.Worthington.com.
8.	Loss prevention. CloudCoins can be backed up and stored off-site, automatically reducing the threat of loss. If you do lose your coins, a lost coin report can be filed, and the coins will be returned to you in five years.
9.	Theft prevention. You can split up your coins and store them in different locations. This allows you to avoid putting "all your eggs into one basket," thereby reducing the risk of theft.
10.	Data is separated from logic. This means you can do anything with CloudCoins, including putting them into software such as accounting systems, banking systems, and our own Sky Wallet.
11.	Crossover currency. CloudCoins can move between the real world and the virtual world and video games.
12.	They can be embedded into digital goods such as jpeg and .png images, mp4s, pdfs, collectibles and in-game items so those digital items can be owned and traded.
RAIDA
The Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents is a data structure that runs the new GRS (Global RAIDA System) that authenticates people, digital items, collectibles, and currencies such as CloudCoin. The owner of the CloudCoin can fix any synchronization problems that occur, making the RAIDA self-healing. Should any of the RAIDA go down, new RAIDA can be brought in to replace them.
Sky Wallet
The Sky Wallet is a private ledger that has data supremacy. The Sky Wallet provides a wrapper around CloudCoins to make CloudCoins easier to send, receive, store, and make change. The Sky Wallet provides pseudo-anonymous privacy, making it less private than CloudCoin, but offering convenience when using CloudCoin.
