#CloudCoin
This repository provides standards and APIs for CloudCoin, RAIDA and SkyWallet.
CloudCoin is a digital currency based on the Theory of Perfect Money. Like crypto-currencies, CloudCoin has data supremacy, meaning that it cannot be hacked, brought down by governments, or even corrupted by its own creators. CloudCoin gets its data supremacy similar to how the DNS System gets its data supremacy. CloudCoin has several unique properties including:
1.	Privacy:  CloudCoin is 100% private. There are no accounts, logins, usernames or public ledgers, which means that CloudCoin cannot be tracked. 
2.	Speed: CloudCoin transacts in mere seconds. Only twenty-five Clouds are required to be updated in parallel.
3.	Globally Scalable: Like the DNS, there is a RAIDA Root Domain and RAIDA subdomains. These domains can handle the entire world's authentication activities.
4.	Availability: CloudCoin is 100% available. The RAIDA has never gone down since it was created in August 2016.
5.	Eco-Friendly: CloudCoin uses less than 10,000 times the amount of electricity than blockchain. CloudCoin just updates databases. No expensive encryption is needed.
6.	Anti-Inflationary: The amount of CloudCoins is fixed—the number of coins will never increase or decrease. Sub-domains handle change and there can be an infinite number of fractions, but these do not create more nominal coins.
7.	Easy Addressing: Used with SkyWallet or other systems, simply use a DNS name for your address such as Sean.Worthington.com
8.	Loss Prevention: CloudCoins can be backed up and stored off-site automatically, reducing the threat of loss. If coins are lost, a lost coin report can be filed and coins will be returned to their owner in five years. 
9.	Theft Prevention: CloudCoins can be split up and stored in different locations. This allows the owner to “not put all your eggs into one basket," which reduces the risk of theft.
10.	Data is Separated from Logic: CloudCoins can be put into any software, such as accounting systems, banking systems, and our own SkyWallet.
11.	Crossover Currency: CloudCoins can move to and from the real world and the virtual world and video games.
12.	Embedding: CloudCoins can be embedded into digital goods such as jpeg images, mp4s, pdfs, and in-game items, so that those digital items can be owned and traded.
RAIDA
The Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents is a data structure that runs the new GRS (Global RAIDA System) that authenticates people, digital items, collectibles, and currencies such as CloudCoins. The owner of the CloudCoin can fix any synchronization problems that occur, making the RAIDA self-healing. Should any of the RAIDA go down, new RAIDA can be brought in to replace them.
SkyWallet
The SkyWallet is a private ledger that has data supremacy. The SkyWallet provides a wrapper around CloudCoins to make CloudCoins easier to send, receive, store and make change. The SkyWallet provides pseudo-anonymous privacy, which makes it less private than CloudCoin, but easy to convert to use CloudCoins.
